# Creating Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions using Tableau's Superstore Sample Data"

## Project Description
Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions allow me narrow down my data to exactly how I Want it. In this project I follow a Tableau tutorial teaching how to create LOD Expressions and shows the four types, FIXED, INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, and Table-Scoped. I will recreate the charts showing sample sales data using these expressions. This project will also include when to use the expressions and how to format them.

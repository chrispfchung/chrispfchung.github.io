I'm a data scientist who excels at machine learning, and data visualizations.

While I explored different fields of interest, I noticed that most members on a team of venture builders had experience with data. I was intrigued and wanted to learn to work with data to help companies achieve their goals. As a data scientist, I also share a passion for using data to make positive business impacts. I have experience in data acquisition, data modeling, statistical analysis and machine learning. With a background in retail and client facing, I bring strong skills in customer service that help retail and financial companies increase their top line.

## Project Description
Visualized Spotify's Weekly Global Top 200 Songs From June-September 2019 and analyzed Most Popular Artists, Most Popular Artists vs. Actual Streams and Most Popular Tracks. The datasets are merged into 1 CSV file and my final product is a Tableau dashboard with 3 different worksheets. I follow Tableau Public and follow the guide "How to visualize Spotify music trends in Tableau" by Scott Teal of the Tableau team. He uses a different dataset. This project will answer questions about songs of Summer 2019 like,

1. Who are the most listened to artists in the world?
2. Which artists do people listen to the longest?
3. What songs are the most popular?
4. What's the relationship between number of tracks and streams?

## Introduction
I use Spotify every day. I like 90s rock, Korean songs, Chinese songs, and Jazz... What does the world like to listen to? In this project, "Visualized Spotify Global's Top 200 Summer Songs 2019 with Tableau", I will make it easy to see who are the top artists and most listened to tracks in the world. We will see how to utilize Tableau to show relationship and make it clear what the data shows.

**Project Replicated From**
<https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2019/7/how-visualize-spotify-music-trends-tableau>

I consulted this website to merge my files with pandas. <https://www.techbeamers.com/pandas-merge-csv-files/>. After merging the 12 CSV files within Python, I open up my Tableau and go to **"Text File"** and select my CSV file labeled *Spotify__Weekly__Streaming.csv*.  Under **Files**, I'm so happy that all the CSV files are there. The Column names are "Unnamed" as it looks like the title names did not carry over. I label them as in the photo below. You can also alter change it directly in the CSV.

Before beginning, check for null values. My main CSV carried over each CSV files' columns so I added a filter to remove the null values from my data. In the top right corner under *Filters*, click **Add**, **Add** again, double click a field with a continuous variable like *Positions* or *Streams*, and click *OK* and *OK*. The null values are removed from our data.

## Most Popular Tracks and Artists
We click **Sheet 1** at the bottom of the left of Tableau and drag **Track Name** in the Columns field. This shows each time a track from the artist showed up on the Top 200 list which is helpful to see how many of the artists' songs ended up on the list over the summer.

1. Once we drag **Track Name** into Columns, change the *Measure* option to *Count (Distinct)*. We'll see that there are 389 unique tracks.
2. Then we drag **Artist** into Rows and sort them by highest to lowest. We'll see which top 3 artists have the most tracks. Ordered by highest tracks. It looks like Ed Sheeran, Billie Eillish, and Shawn Mendes.
3. Now we drag **Streams** into Columns. According to Spotify, a stream is counted when a user listens for over 30 seconds. Teal, the author of the original post, makes a point that although there can be more of the artists' tracks on the list it doesn't mean that the author had the most streams, or listening time. Looking at the graph, although Taylor Swift is in second place for highest number of tracks, there are several artists that have more streams than her! We'll see this relationship clearer in the next step.

4. To a different view of the relationship between **Streams** and **Track Name**, we can look at a scatter plot. Add a **New Worksheet** and go to **Show Me** in the top corner and select the *scatter plots* option. All the points to the right of Taylor Swift have more streams than her though she has a high number of tracks. Nonetheless with 18 tracks over 12 weeks and high streams, she has much more presence than the rest of the points. We can see the majority of tracks have between 0-200 Million streams with 1-3 tracks. We see Ed Sheeran in the top right blowing everyone out of the water in terms of number of tracks and streams. I don't blame Spotify listeners, his songs are amazing!

Now let's look at the popularity of the tracks. Add a **New Worksheet**.

1. We drag **Track Name** into Rows and **SUM(Streams)** into Columns and sort them by descending order.
2. Shawn Mendes' "Se√±orita" is by far the highest at 626 million streams while second place is Ed Sheeran's "I Don't Care" with Justin Bieber at 359 million streams!

## Dashboard
1. Add a **New Dashboard** and drag your *Sheets* on to the dashboard.
2. Organize it the way that you like it. I organized mine by Click on the **Layout** tab next to **Dashboard**, right clicking each chart in *Item Hierarchy* and separating them.
3. Click each bar chart and select the funnel **Use as Filter** so that when you click an artist or track, the rest of the charts will pull information related to it. For example, if you click Taylor Swift in "Most Popular Artists", all of her tracks are selected on the "Most Popular Tracks" chart and number of streams show up on our scatter plot.
4. Customize the dashboard's color, borders, shading, and title sizes by going to *Format* at the top of the screen and select Dashboard.

You can interact with [this dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/christopher.chung1603#!/vizhome/VisualizedSpotifyGlobalsTop200SummerSongs2019withTableau/SummerSongs2019Dashboard) on Tableau Public.

## Conclusion
This was a fun project that let me see what the world is listening to. It's cool to see that some artists dominate the rest like Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes. I also thought it was interesting that most tracks doesn't mean that they have the most listening time. I went back the next day and decided that my original layout was not very clear. I had the layout in thirds like a long hamburger but I felt that the information was hard to access. After messing around looking at other people's examples, I saw that I could manually rearrange the charts and format the colors.

## Next Steps
In the next project, I will use the author's dataset to create a map & streaming activity dashboard to take a closer look at what songs each country is listening to!

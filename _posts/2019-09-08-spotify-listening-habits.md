## Project Description
Creating visualizations is one of the best ways to understand your data. It allows you to quickly answer questions in a memorable format. In this project, I am going to use Tableau to visualize my Spotify listening habits over the last 3 months and answer a number of questions, with obvious ones like discovering my favorite tracks and artists, and also more in-depth questions like my tastes over time, how often I switch, when I listen the most, and more.

These questions guided my analyis.

1. Who do you listen to the most, top 3 tracks top 3 artists?
2. Which albums do I have on repeat?
3. What are my favorite genres in the last 3 months?
4. Did my tastes change over the 3 months?
5. Which artists can I re-discover?
6. Did I listen to movie/show soundtracks?
7. How often do I listen to Spotify?
8. Per day? Per month? Per year?
9. Have I tried new artists?
10. How often do I switch to a new artist?


## Project Replicated From:

I consulted this site to understand my downloaded Spotify data. This was important so I know what my data means. <https://support.spotify.com/us/account_payment_help/privacy/understanding-my-data/>

## Create Calculation Fields

## Most Listened To Artists
Top 3 artists: Lena Raine, Bill Evans, and Rain. As we'll see in the next sheet, I listened to one of Lena Raine's songs nonstop for some period of time. I recently discovered Bill Evans and he's become one of my favorite jazz musicians. One of his albums, "Symbiosis" is one of my favorites!

## Most Listened To Tracks
Top 3 Tracks: "Quiet and Falling" by Lena Raine, a Korean song by Rain, and "Mississippi" by Bob Dylan. I'm pretty surprised by the amount of Bob Dylan I had on repeat. For "Quiet and Falling" and "Missisippi" I remember there was a period of time when I heard from multiple sources that listening to a song on repeat helped you get into a flow state better. Did it work? As long as the music was able to provide some consistent background noise, then it worked. Otherwise it's a distraction as though you put any other song on.
